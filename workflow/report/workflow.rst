**WIPAR** (**W** idefield **I** maging **P** ipeline for **A** nalysis and **R** egression) is a data pipeline for processing and analysing task-specific (widefield) calcium imaging data through neural decoding. Here, calcium activity is a proxy for neuronal activations. It provides stand-alone functionalities to visualize the data analysis as well as enabling the export of processed data for other visualization purposes.
