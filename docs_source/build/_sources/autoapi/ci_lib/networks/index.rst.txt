.. py:class:: MOU(C=None, tau_x=1.0, mu=0.0, Sigma=None, random_state=None, logger=None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`sklearn.base.BaseEstimator`

   
   Description of the class and a summary of its parameters, attributes and
   methods.


   :Parameters:

       **n_nodes** : integer
           Number of nodes in the network.

       **J** : ndarray of rank-2
           Jacobian matrix between the nodes. The diagonal corresponds to a vector
           of time constants. For off-diagonal elements, the first dimension 
           corresponds to target nodes and the second dimension to source nodes 
           (J_ij is from i to j).

       **mu** : ndarray of rank-1
           Mean vector of the inputs to the nodes.

       **Sigma** : ndarray of rank-2
           Covariance matrix of the inputs to the nodes (multivariate Wiener process).

      Estimation of MOU parameters (connectivity C, noise covariance Sigma,
      and time constant tau_x) with Lyapunov optimization as in: Gilson et al.
      Plos Computational Biology (2016).


      :Parameters:

          **Q_obj** : ndarray
              The covariance matrix

          **i_tau_opt** : integer (optional)
              Mask of known non-zero values for connectivity matrix, for example
              estimated by DTI.

          **mask_C** : boolean ndarray of rank-2 (optional)
              Mask of known non-zero values for connectivity matrix, for example
              estimated by DTI. By default, all connections are allowed (except
              self-connections)

          **mask_Sigma** : boolean ndarray of rank-2 (optional)
              Mask of known non-zero values for the input covariance matrix
              (by default diagonal).

          **epsilon_C** : float (optional)
              Learning rate for connectivity (this should be about n_nodes times
              smaller than epsilon_Sigma).

          **epsilon_Sigma** : float (optional)
              Learning rate for Sigma (this should be about n_nodes times larger
              than epsilon_EC).

          **regul_C** : float (optional)
              Regularization parameter for connectivity. Try first a value of 0.5.

          **regul_Sigma** : float (optional)

          **min_val_C** : float (optional)
              Minimum value to bound connectivity estimate. This should be zero
              or slightly negative (too negative limit can bring to an inhibition
              dominated system). If the empirical covariance has many negative
              entries then a slightly negative limit can improve the estimation
              accuracy.

          **max_val_C** : float (optional)
              Maximum value to bound connectivity estimate. This is useful to
              avoid large weight that make the system unstable. If the estimated
              connectivity saturates toward this value (it usually doesn't happen)
              it can be increased.

          **max_iter** : integer (optional)
              Number of maximum optimization steps. If final number of iterations
              reaches this maximum it means the algorithm has not converged.

          **min_iter** : integer (optional)
              Number of minimum optimization steps before testing if end of 
              optimization (increase of model error).
