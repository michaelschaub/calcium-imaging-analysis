WIPAR
=====

**WIPAR** (**W**\ idefield **I**\ maging **P**\ ipeline for **A**\ nalysis and **R**\ egression) is a data pipeline for processing and analysing task-specific (widefield) calcium imaging data through neural decoding.
Here, calcium activity is a proxy for neuronal activations.
It provides stand-alone functionalities to visualize the data analysis as well as enabling the export of processed data for other visualization purposes.

Getting started
---------------

* To get a first impression of the results you can generate with WIPAR, please have a look at an exemplary `report <https://raw.github.com/michaelschaub/calcium-imaging-analysis/blob/readthedocs/report.html>`_ that is automatically compiled.
* To get started :ref:`install WIPAR and it's requirements <installation>`
* For an example on how to use WIPAR and general guidelines have a look at the :ref:`tutorial <tutorial>`
